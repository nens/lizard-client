fields removed from 3 to 4:
- slug -> slug is used so much that I wonder if it will not be faster to make options work for api/v3/rasters with custom colormap
- frequency -> frequency can maybe be replaced by interval, but is also quite often used
- origin -> not used
- timesteps_url -> CTRL + F not used 
- optimizer -> CTRL + F not used 
- "wms_info": { example_url" -> CTRL + F not used in lizard client

fields changed:
- origin became: CTRL + F not used 
"origin_x": 83418.5,
    "origin_y": 442553.0,  ???
